Malaria deaths are very hard on families and can destroy the potential of future generations. \r\n\r\n**It ruins education**\r\n\r\nEven if a child survives malaria, it may force them to miss important days of school.  Severe cases can also result in lifelong learning difficulties. Malaria is responsible for destroying the education of too many children, even though it can be prevented.\r\n\r\n**It destroys the economy**\r\n\r\nMalaria takes people away from work, taking valuable income away from many families. In 2012, malaria cost the economy of Pakistan approximately 31.5 Billion Rupee in lost productivity and treatment costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n**It is completely preventable and treatable**\r\n\r\nAll this damage is unnecessary and can be avoided. By learning about prevention and treatment, you can help prepare for the fight ahead. Learn about malaria prevention and malaria treatment.\r\n",
