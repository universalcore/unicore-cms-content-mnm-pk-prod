This is called targeted insecticide spraying, and can help keep your family safe.\r\n\r\n**Finish your pills!**\r\n\r\nIf you are given treatment, finishing your malaria pills is important step to removing the parasite from your body. Even if you don\u2019t feel sick anymore, take all of your malaria treatment or you remain a threat to your family!",
